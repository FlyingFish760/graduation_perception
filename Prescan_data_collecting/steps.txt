1. Create a new scenaio
 - Change the object ids of the same traffic signs to the same
 - Build a .pex file on Prescan

2. Update the simulink model 
 - Update the simulink file in Matlab (run the second section of file runExperiment.m)
 - Add the bouding_rectangle block
 - Add a to_workspace linked to object list provider
 - tickle on the "save results" option in the CameraSensor_1_CM_Display module

3. Run the simulation
 - Make the ROS side and the Prescan are using the same WIFI
 - Launch a ros agent on the ROS side
 - Start the Prescan experiment on the Prescan side (runt the third section of file runExperiment.m)
 - Run the symaware controller on the ROS side (python3 ..eicsymaware/exampels/ros.py)
 - Stop the controller on the ROS side
 - (wait for 3 secs to make sure the camera data and bounding data have the same timestamps)
 - Stop the Prescan experiment on the Prescan side
